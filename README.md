just sends the text to standard out. Alternatively it opens the
Wikipedia article in a (possibly GUI) web browser or just shows the
URL of the appropriate Wikipedia article.

###Installation
copy wikipedia2text into your $PATH

alternatively, on debian or derivitatives, you can install it using your
packages manager: `sudo apt-get install wikipedia2text`
